# software_defined_networking_sdn

## what is software defined networking ?
 - seprate data plene and control plane
 - control network behviour from single high level control program
 - two parts to the infrastructure
    - data plane : programmable switches
    - control plane : controllers , apps
## where sdn came from ?
 - distributed configuration : buggy , unpredictable
 - instead - control the network from a logically centralized high level program

   ## advantages of sdn over conventional
   - easier to coordinate behaviour among a network devices
   - easier to evolve
   - apply conventional computer science approaches (programming languages , software engineerings , testing ) to old problems


     ## sdn infrastructure : two parts
     - software control plane
       - the network is brain
       - can be run seprately from devices
       - computer logic of how traffic will be forwarded
     - programmable data plane
       - typically programmable hardware
       - controlled by controlled plane
      
     ## sdn applications
      - data centre
      - wide area backbone networks
      - enterprise network
      - internet exchange point
      - home networks
